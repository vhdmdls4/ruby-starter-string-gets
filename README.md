# Ruby String Manipulation Tool

This repository contains a command-line application built in Ruby aimed at enhancing your understanding of string manipulation, functions, and user input handling within the Ruby programming language.

## Features

- **String Reversal:** Reverse any string input by the user.
- **String Case Conversion:** Convert strings to uppercase or lowercase.
- **Substring Finder:** Locate substrings within a given string.
- **String Concatenation:** Combine two strings together.
- **String Length Calculation:** Determine the length of a given string.

## How to Use

This interactive tool prompts users to select from various string manipulation operations. Input your strings and observe the results of different manipulations performed on them. Each operation is encapsulated within its own method to illustrate modular programming principles.

## Learning Points

This project aims to help you grasp fundamental concepts of Ruby programming:

- **Function Definition and Usage:** Explore the creation and use of functions/methods in Ruby.
- **User Input Handling:** Understand `gets.chomp` for receiving input from the command line.
- **String Manipulation Techniques:** Apply built-in string manipulation methods available in Ruby, such as `reverse`, `upcase`, `downcase`, `include?`, `concat`, `length`, among others.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Expand functionalities with additional string manipulation features.
- Improve user interface and interactivity.
